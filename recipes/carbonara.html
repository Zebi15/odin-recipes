        <h1>Carbonara</h1>
        <img src="images/carbonara.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="auto">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Carbonara is a beautiful, classic Italian pasta that’s so creamy, you’d swear there’s a good amount of cream in it.
           And indeed, there’s plenty of recipes that cheat by adding in cream.</p>
        <p>But today, we’re making spaghetti carbonara properly, the authentic, traditional way.
           No cream. Just egg, cheese and a splash of starchy pasta cooking water.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Guanciale</li>
            <li>Parmigiano reggiano</li>
            <li>Egg yolks</li>
            <li>Spaghetti</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Batons – Cut the guanciale into thick batons. Biting through the golden brown crust into meaty bits of salty guanciale is part of the awesomeness that is carbonara!</li>
            <li>Finely grate the parmigiana reggiano or pecorino. I use a microplane</li>
            <li>Sauce – Whisk together the egg, cheese and pepper in a large bowl. It needs to be a large bowl because the pasta will be stirred into the sauce in the bowl, off the stove, to avoid scrambling the eggs.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta – Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with 1 tablespoon of salt. Cook the pasta per packet directions. It should be firm, not soft, but fully cooked through.</li>
            <li>Reserve pasta cooking water – Just before draining, scoop out one cup of pasta cooking water. Then drain the pasta in a colander.</li>
            <li>Cook guanciale until golden while the pasta is cooking. You don’t need any oil, the guanciale will fry in its own fat.</li>
            <li>Toss pasta in guanciale – Tumble the hot pasta into the pan with the guanciale then toss so the pasta gets coated in the guanciale fat.</li>
            <li>Transfer into sauce bowl – Tip the hot pasta into the bowl with the egg and use a rubber spatula to scrape out every drop of the guanciale fat into the bowl. That stuff is gold!</li>
            <li>Add 1/2 cup pasta cooking water into the bowl</li>
            <li>Mix vigorously with the handle of a wooden spoon, spinning the pasta around, for around 30 seconds to 1 minute. Watch as the watery pale yellow liquid magically transforms into a creamy sauce.
                <br>
                You know it’s ready when the sauce is no longer watery and pooled in the bottom of the bowl. Instead, it will be thickened, creamy, and clinging to the pasta! </li>
            <li>Serve immediately in warm bowls. Pasta waits for no one!</li>
        </ol>
